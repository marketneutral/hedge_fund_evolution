## What Evolution?

Two trends

- Unbundling
- Human + Machine Collaboration



# Theory

## Condorcet Jury Theorem (1785)
- The *Condorcet Jury Theorem* states that if each member of a jury has a probability greater than 1/2 of making the correct decision, then as the number of jurors increases, the probability that the majority decision is correct approaches 1.

$$
P(\text{majority correct}) \to 1 \text{ as } n \to \infty \\
\iff \text{independence of errors}
$$

. . .

- e.g., `sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier` relies on this result.

## Boosting Weak Learners (1988)
::: {.incremental}
- Kearns, Michael. *Thoughts on Hypothesis Boosting*. 1988.
- Friedman, Jerome H. *Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine*. 2001.
- Sequentially train many "weak learner" models, each focusing on the errors of the previous ones.
- Gradient boosted decision trees are the dominant approach in tabular machine learning still today.
- e.g., `sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, `catboost`
:::

## Boosting in a Nutshell {.smaller}
::: {.incremental}
- $F_M$ is the ensemble model. After **M** rounds:
$$
F_M(x) = F_0(x) + \sum_{m=1}^M \gamma\, h_m(x)
$$
- Each round fits $h_m$ to the **negative gradient of the loss** at $F_{m-1}$, then updates:
$$
F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \gamma\, h_m(x)
$$
- $\gamma$ is the learning rate; $h_m$ is a weak learner (e.g., shallow tree).
:::


## Model Stacking (1992)
::: {.incremental}
- Wolpert, David H. *Stacked Generalization*. 1992.
- Train "meta-model" on the predictions of independent base models.
- Works best when base models are diverse and capture different aspects of the data.
- e.g., `sklearn.ensemble.StackingClassifier`
:::

## Stacking in a Nutshell {.smaller}
::: {.incremental}
- Combine several different models by training a **meta-model** on their predictions.
  - Train **M** independent base models $(f_1, \dots, f_M)$ (e.g., linear model, tree, neural net, etc.).
  - Using an appropriate cross validation scheme, collect **out-of-fold** predictions for each training example to avoid leakage.
  - Train a meta-model $(g)$ on these predictions (optionally with the original features).
$$
\hat{y}(x) = g\!\big(f_1(x),\, f_2(x),\, \dots,\, f_M(x)\big)
$$
:::

## Ensemble Methods Summary
::: {.incremental}
- *Voting*: combine models, majority vote.
- *Boosting*: **sequentially** build models, each correcting the previous.
- *Stacking*: combine diverse models, leveraging their strengths.
  - *Model Averaging* is a special case of stacking: the meta-model is a weighted linear sum.
:::

## Stacking into Boosting
- Why not both?
```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|5|8,9,10,11"
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

lin = Pipeline([
  ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
  ("lr", LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))
])

stack = StackingClassifier(estimators=[("lin", lin)],
  final_estimator=LGBMClassifier(),
  stack_method="predict_proba", passthrough=True, cv=cv
)

stack.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = stack.predict(X_test)
```


## The Dunbar Number (1992)
::: {.incremental}
- Dunbar, R. I. M. (1992). *Neocortex size as a constraint on group size in primates.* Journal of Human Evolution, 22(6), 469–493.
- Max human maintainable stable relationships ≈ 150
- Limit of trust & cohesion
- Beyond limit → silos, slow decisions, culture strain
:::

## Dunbar cont'd: How Hedge Funds Manage It
::: {.incremental}
- 👉 Scale by respecting Dunbar  
  - *Pods* → small teams, central risk  
  - *Quant* → structure as an assembly line  
  - *Lean* → keep a cap on size, preserve culture  
  - *Bureaucracy* → heavy process to scale  
:::

## Wisdom of Crowds (2004) {.smaller}
::: {.incremental}
- Surowiecki, James. *The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies, and Nations*. Doubleday, 2004.
- For the crowd to be smarter than experts, we require
  - *Diversity of opinion* → different perspectives reduce blind spots
  - *Independence of members* → avoid groupthink
  - *Decentralization* → empower local knowledge
  - *Aggregation of information* → combine insights effectively
:::

## The Common Task Framework (2007-)
::: {.incremental}
- Donoho, D. (2017). "50 Years of Data Science." *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 26(4), 745–766.
  - *Define a clear task (e.g., image recognition).*
  - *Provide dataset + ground truth labels + hidden test set.*
  - *Set evaluation metric (accuracy, F1, etc.).*  
  - *Run open competition among researchers.*
- *Netflix Prize* (2006), *Kaggle* (2010), *ImageNet* (2012)...
:::

## Common Task Framework (cont'd)

- "The Kaggle Grandmasters Playbook: 7 Battle-Tested Modeling Techniques for Tabular Data", September 18, 2025, Nvidia Blog, [link.](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/the-kaggle-grandmasters-playbook-7-battle-tested-modeling-techniques-for-tabular-data/)

![](https://developer-blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaggle-Grandmasters-Playbook-featured-1536x864-png.webp){width="80%"}


## Machine, Platform, Crowd (2017)
::: {.incremental}
- Bryan McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson. *Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future*. W. W. Norton & Company, 2017.
  - *Wisdom of crowd means groups > individual experts*
  - *Platforms unlock assets (Uber, Airbnb)*
  - *Innovation from open-source & collaboration*
  - *Trust via ratings (leaderboards)*
  - *Success is $f(\text{incentives}, \text{governance})$*
:::

## Theory Takeaways
::: {.incremental}
- Successes in machine learning demonstrate the critical importance of ensemble methods.
- The Common Task Framework has driven scientific progress at scale.
- Social science principles can inform on the design of incentives and processes to harness collective intelligence.

# Unbundling


## Introduction

- Traditional hedge funds: small teams, opaque processes, high fees  
- New paradigm: **decentralized hedge funds**  
  - Crowdsourced intelligence  
  - Blockchain-based incentives  
  - Global participation  
- Case studies: **Numerai**, **Yiedl**, **CrowdCent**

---

## Numerai – Overview

- San Francisco–based hedge fund (founded 2015)  
- **Crowdsources stock market predictions** from global data scientists  
- Uses a **meta-model**: ensemble of community models aggregated into live trading strategy  
- Mission: *“solve the hardest problem in finance”* with diverse, anonymized datasets  

---

## Numerai – Community & Competitions

- Weekly **data science tournaments**  
- Participants submit ML predictions on anonymized market data  
- Scored on correlation with actual returns  
- **Staking with NMR tokens**:  
  - Stake NMR = confidence in predictions  
  - Rewards for accuracy, penalties for errors  

---

## Numerai – Data & Roles

- **Company:** curates data, manages fund, constructs stake-weighted meta-model  
- **Community:** builds models, submits predictions, stakes tokens  
- Data: anonymized, obfuscated stock/market datasets  
- Company executes trades; community generates intelligence  

---

## Numerai – Role of Crypto

- **Numeraire (NMR):** first hedge-fund-issued cryptocurrency  
- Staking aligns incentives: accurate models gain rewards, inaccurate lose stake  
- All payouts and stakes occur via Ethereum smart contracts  
- Supports **trustless, global participation**  

---

## Yiedl – Overview

- Founded 2023, fully **DAO-based hedge fund**  
- Mission: *replace fund managers with blockchain data science tournaments*  
- Operates via **on-chain vaults** on Optimism + Synthetix  
- Managed by token holders, not a centralized GP  

---

## Yiedl – Community & Competitions

- Weekly **crypto-asset prediction tournaments**  
- Participants forecast asset returns, stake Yiedl tokens  
- Predictions stored/encrypted on IPFS & blockchain  
- Smart contracts auto-reward/penalize based on accuracy  
- Two tracks:  
  - **Neutral vault:** rank assets for market-neutral strategy  
  - **UpDown vault:** propose portfolio weights  

---

## Yiedl – Data & Roles

- **Data:** curated decade-long crypto datasets (prices, on-chain metrics, sentiment)  
- **Community:** builds predictive models, stakes tokens, governs DAO  
- **Company/DAO:** develops infrastructure, aggregates predictions, executes trades via smart contracts  
- Division: community = *what to trade*, DAO = *how to implement*  

---

## Yiedl – Role of Crypto

- **YIEDL token:**  
  - Staking in competitions  
  - Governance (DAO voting)  
  - Rewards for accurate predictions  
- All trades executed via DeFi protocols (Synthetix)  
- On-chain fund = transparent, auditable, permissionless  

---

## CrowdCent – Overview

- Hybrid crowdsourced investment platform (2022–2023)  
- Combines **fundamental analysts + data scientists**  
- Mission: *democratize asset management with human + machine intelligence*  
- “Next-generation of investing: decentralized, systematized, democratized”  

---

## CrowdCent – Community & Competitions

- **Analysts:** share investment theses (e.g. via SumZero)  
- **Data Scientists:** join open ML challenges to evaluate ideas  
- Examples:  
  - **Hyperliquid Challenge:** rank crypto assets by 10–30d returns  
  - **Equity NLP Challenge:** analyze analyst reports for predictive alpha  
- Leaderboards, percentile scoring, meta-model aggregation  

---

## CrowdCent – Data & Roles

- **Data:**  
  - Fundamental research from SumZero (analyst reports, ratings)  
  - Market + crypto data, engineered features  
- **Community:**  
  - Analysts generate qualitative ideas  
  - Data scientists build quantitative models  
- **Company:** runs competitions, integrates data, manages portfolio construction & execution  

---

## CrowdCent – Role of Crypto

- No native token (as of 2025)  
- **Crypto as an asset class:** community builds crypto strategies (Hyperliquid challenge)  
- **Integration with crypto projects:**  
  - Fund that stakes in Numerai’s NMR ecosystem  
  - Bridges decentralized funds together  
- Less “on-chain” than Yiedl, but embraces crypto markets and ethos  

---

## Conclusion

- **Numerai:** pioneered crypto-incentivized crowdsourced hedge fund  
- **Yiedl:** DAO-based, on-chain hedge fund built entirely with DeFi  
- **CrowdCent:** blends human fundamental research with ML and crypto strategies  
- Common threads:  
  - Community-driven intelligence  
  - Machine learning aggregation  
  - Cryptocurrency as incentive + infrastructure  
- Future hedge funds: **open, decentralized, global**  


# Human + Machine


## Types of Collaboration
- Horizontal
- Vertical

## Horizontal

- Human forecasts concatenated with machine forecasts
- Fit model on both

## Vertical

- Stepwise: human first, machine second (or vice versa)


## Motivation

- Canonical view: “Public” info is free and instantly priced (EMH).
- Reality: Converting public data → stock picks is **costly** (analysts, data prep, modeling, infra, time).
- Research question: **How large are the *economic* costs of processing public information?**

## Study Design (High Level)

- Population: **3,337** active, diversified U.S. equity mutual funds (1990–2020).
- Build an **AI analyst** that uses *only* public data and **realistic constraints**.
- Compare:
  - Human manager (actual holdings)
  - **AI-modified** (hybrid; selective replacements)
  - **AI-only** (full replacement within style constraints)
- Measure: **Dollar alpha** and **Sharpe**; treat forgone gains as **lower bound** of managers’ marginal info-processing costs.

## Key Findings (Punchline)

- **AI-modified**: +**$17.1M** incremental **per quarter** vs. human; **~93%** of managers outperformed over their lifetimes.
- **AI-only**: +**$17.2M** incremental per quarter; ~**42%** allocated to style indices without hurting results.
- Sharpe improves materially (details ahead).
- Results robust to risk models, transaction costs, benchmark identification, and incentive heterogeneity.

## Conceptual Framework

- Investors process info until **marginal cost = marginal gain**.
- If AI (public info only) can improve a manager’s portfolio under the manager’s constraints, the **forgone gains** represent a **lower-bound** on the manager’s marginal info costs.
- Human + machine is evaluated **within** fund style/risk/size/liquidity constraints.

## Data Inputs (Public Only)

- **Market** (CRSP): prices, returns (incl. delisting), volatility, beta, liquidity/volume, market cap.
- **Accounting** (Compustat point-in-time; proper lags): profitability, accruals, leverage, growth, etc.
- **Analysts** (I/B/E/S): consensus EPS, recommendations, price targets (careful timing; summary files).
- **Text** (EDGAR): 10-K/Q and 8-K tone/complexity/uncertainty (point-in-time release).
- **Macro** (Welch–Goyal set): term/default spreads, D/P, E/P, etc.
- **Ratings**: S&P long-term issuer ratings.
- ~**170** features; winsorization by feature type; point-in-time construction to avoid look-ahead.

## Return Target & Benchmarking

- Predict **quarter-ahead** stock returns:
  - Preferred: **DGTW benchmark-adjusted** returns (size × B/M × momentum groups).
  - Also considered: excess returns vs. risk-free.
- Portfolio construction and evaluation are **within DGTW groups** to preserve style.

## ML Pipeline (Pseudocode)

```pseudo
# =========================
# FEATURES & LABELS
# =========================
for each month t in 1980..2020:
    X_t := features available by end of t-1 (market, accounting (lagged), IBES, EDGAR text, macro, ratings)
    y_t := realized stock return over t+1..t+3 (DGTW-adjusted preferred)

# Preprocess within training folds only:
# - Winsorize features (type-specific rules)
# - Impute missing (numeric: quarter-mean; categorical/flags: 0)
# - Standardize numeric using train stats

# =========================
# ROLLING EXPANDING TRAINING
# =========================
for prediction year Y in 1986..2020:
    train_period := 1980-01 .. (Y-1)-10  # end in Oct Y-1 to avoid quarter overlap
    # time-series cross-validated randomized hyperparameter search (RF depth, trees, min split/leaf, mtry)
    fit RandomForest_Y on train_period to minimize validation MSE

    # =========================
    # PREDICT MONTHLY IN YEAR Y
    # =========================
    for each month t in Y:
        ŷ_t := RandomForest_Y.predict(X_t)
        # also compute within-DGTW ranks/deciles for portfolio rules

# Optionally also fit a Neural Network model; ensemble via average rank to get a small lift.
```

## What Drives Predictions?

Permutation importance analysis shows simple features are highly influential:

- Market value, dollar volume, trading activity, earnings-forecast signals.  
- RF captures nonlinear interactions among simple predictors.  

## Portfolio Construction – Shared Constraints

- No shorting; quarterly rebalance only.  
- Within-style swaps: replacements must come from the same DGTW group.  
- Depth/liquidity: cap any single holding to ≤ 20% of the stock’s market cap (clip and keep overflow).  
- No duplicate replacements (“without replacement” within a fund/quarter).  
- Payout convention: AI’s incremental gain is paid out quarterly so human and AI start next quarter with equal AUM (conservative for AI in dollars).  

## AI-Modified (Hybrid) – Pseudocode

```pseudo
inputs:
  w_h[j]      # human start-of-quarter weight for stock j
  g[j]        # DGTW group of stock j
  decile[j]   # predicted decile within g[j] (1=worst ... 10=best)
  ŷ[j]        # predicted DGTW-adjusted return
  NAV         # fund net asset value at start of quarter

initialize:
  w_ai := w_h
  used := ∅    # prevent duplicate use of replacement names

# Keep strong human picks
for j in holdings sorted by descending w_h[j]:
    if decile[j] == 10:
        used.add(j)

# Attempt upgrades for others (largest positions first)
for j in holdings sorted by descending w_h[j]:
    if decile[j] in 1..9:
        group := g[j]
        C := { s in group | decile[s] == 10 and s ∉ used }
        if C ≠ ∅:
            # choose best candidate
            k := argmax_s∈C ŷ[s]
            target_value := w_h[j] * NAV
            max_value := 0.20 * market_cap(k)
            delta_value := min(target_value, max_value)
            w_ai[k] +=  delta_value / NAV
            w_ai[j] -=  delta_value / NAV
            used.add(k)

# Replace remaining bottom-decile names with the group index
for j in holdings:
    if decile[j] == 1 and w_ai[j] > 0:
        idx := index_for_group(g[j])
        w_ai[idx] += w_ai[j]
        w_ai[j]   = 0

# Normalize / clean
project w_ai onto the simplex (weights ≥ 0, sum = 1)
```

## AI-Only (Full Replacement) – Pseudocode

```pseudo
inputs as above
initialize:
  w_ai := 0
  used := ∅
  backlog[group] := 0 for all groups

# Map each human slot to a top-decile name in the same group
for j in human holdings sorted by descending w_h[j]:
    group := g[j]
    C := { s in group | decile[s] == 10 and s ∉ used }
    if C ≠ ∅:
        k := argmax_s∈C ŷ[s]
        target_value := w_h[j] * NAV
        max_value := 0.20 * market_cap(k)
        delta_value := min(target_value, max_value)
        w_ai[k] += delta_value / NAV
        used.add(k)
        # any leftover because of cap stays to be assigned:
        if delta_value < target_value:
            backlog[group] += (target_value - delta_value) / NAV
    else:
        backlog[group] += w_h[j]

# Push any leftover weight to the group index
for each group:
    if backlog[group] > 0:
        idx := index_for_group(group)
        w_ai[idx] += backlog[group]

project w_ai onto the simplex
```

## Performance Measurement – Dollar Alpha

Let Rᵐᵢ,𝑞 be fund i’s gross return from observed holdings in quarter q.  
Let Rᵇᵢ,𝑞 be the corresponding DGTW benchmark return (same weights, matched groups).

Dollar alpha (human):

Vᵢ,𝑞 = Assetsᵢ,𝑞−1 (Rᵐᵢ,𝑞 − Rᵇᵢ,𝑞)

Incremental dollars (AI over human):

Zᵢ,𝑞 = Assetsᵢ,𝑞−1 (Rᴬᴵᵢ,𝑞 − Rᵐᵢ,𝑞)

Aggregate to lifetime averages per fund, then time-weighted across funds.

Sharpe Ratio (Definition & Use)

For fund i with quarterly excess returns ERᵢ,𝑡 = Rᵢ,𝑡 − Rʳᶠₜ:

Sharpeᵢ = ( mean(ERᵢ) / σ(ERᵢ,𝑡) ) × √16

Compare paired Sharpe differences:

ΔSharpeᵢ = Sharpeᵢᴬᴵ − Sharpeᵢᴴᵘᵐᵃⁿ

## Findings:

- Avg human Sharpe ≈ 0.47.  
- Avg paired difference (AI-modified − human) ≈ +0.17 (t ≈ 69).  
- ~95% of funds show a positive Sharpe improvement.  
- Similar uplifts for AI-only.  

## Risk Adjustments & Robustness

- Factor alphas: FF5 + momentum, and with mispricing factors → AI outperformance persists or widens.  
- Sharpe and CDF dominance: AI nearly first-order stochastically dominates human quarterly performance.  
- Transaction costs:
  - Implied quarterly turnover: Human ~20%; AI-modified ~52% stocks + 3% indices; AI-only ~40% stocks + 10% indices.  
  - Institutional cost estimates (≈13–37 bps per stock trade) → AI still dominates net of costs.  
- Benchmarks: Results hold when restricting to funds with verified size/value benchmarks and style-consistent holdings.  
- Incentives: Results hold for direct-sold (sophisticated) funds and for funds flagged as quantitative.  

## Why Human + Machine?

- Public-signal extraction is a skill; AI scales nonlinearity & interactions across simple signals.  
- Constrained, style-consistent AI can deliver practical outperformance (not just paper alpha).  

## Hybrid process:  
- Humans: mandate, domain context, governance, risk/compliance, private info where valuable.  
- Machines: breadth, speed, nonlinearity, consistent execution, monitoring, “what-if”s.  

## Implementation Tips (Practitioner Slide)

- Data ops: point-in-time joins; strict lags; feature health checks; backtest hygiene (no leakage).  
- Modeling: rolling expanding windows; time-series CV; monitor drift; ensemble RF/NN ranks.  
- PM integration: within-style candidate pools; depth caps; turnover budgets; quarterly (or monthly) cadence; explicit payout/compounding policy.  
- Risk: side-by-side factor loads; pre/post-trade limits; stress; transaction-cost controls.  

## Limitations & Scope

- Results are partial-equilibrium (single fund adopting AI). Widespread adoption → greater price impact, lower marginal gains.  
- Lower-bound cost estimate: conservative sizing; quarterly payout prevents compounding of AI gains; RF today < RF+NN tomorrow.  
- Private information could still add value; study quantifies public-info processing costs.  

## Takeaways

- Managers left economically large returns on the table by not further processing public data.  
- Human + machine collaboration substantially improves risk-adjusted performance under real constraints.  
- Challenges the idea that public info is “free” to use; processing costs are material.  
- As AI improves, the shadow price of public information likely rises.
